# gbot lite version
A sleeker version of my general purpose discord bot.

This bot leverages Discord's ability to store messages in 
order to retain server-specific settings information without 
using databases or JSON files. Unfortunately features like 
playing music and making notes aren't supported, but most 
features from older versions have been included in this 
version as well.

# To start your own instance:
add 'token.txt' to the root directory and paste in your Discord 
token from the Discord dev portal.
